# gtreeCore: Game-Theoretic Representation of Economic Experiments

Author: Sebastian Kranz, Ulm University

This package contains gtree core functions to parse and convert game formats and solve for equilibria.

For the game theoretic analysis the json specification jg is transformed into Gambit efg format and the Gambit solvers are used to compute equilibria.
